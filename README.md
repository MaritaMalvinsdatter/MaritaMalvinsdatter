### Hi there 👋

I'm Marita, nice to meet you! I'm a junior front-end develper looking for new opportunities, whilst studying back-end.
I started coding when having too much time on my hand during Covid-19, which then led me to start studying frontend development at Noroff - School of Technology and Digital Media. Excited about learning new coding languages, and even though it can be really challenging sometimes it's also very rewarding. I love starting with a blanck page and turning into a working project. Happy coding!
